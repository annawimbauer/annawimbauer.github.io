abstract="Efficient and quick detection of problems is an essential task in online process monitoring. Many anomaly detection approaches excel in finding local deviations. We propose a novel approach that tracks local deviations over multiple process instances and visualizes correlations of deviation points. PErrCas provides knowledge about current cascades of deviations to give process analysts a starting point for rational root-cause analysis if processes leave their in-control parameters. PErrCas monitors deviations online and maintains cascades of varying timespans. Hence, our approach avoids defining an observation window beforehand, which is a significant advantage due to its impracticability to predefine expected cascade properties in exploratory scenarios.",
